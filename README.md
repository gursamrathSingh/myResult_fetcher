# myResult_fetcher
A Web - Scrapping Project

The project aims at reducing the navigation on the Thapar-Webkiosk website (saving our souls from the old-school UI) and getting your important info at the Command Line Interface (CLI) with just one click.

Python Libraries used are Beautiful Soup, Mechanical Soup, and others.
To execute, download the .exe file and give the required permission to run on your machine.
